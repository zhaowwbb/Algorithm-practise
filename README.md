# Algorithm-practise
Purpose:<br>
The idea of this project is to help people who want to improve their coding skills for algorithm, I found although a lot of resource about algorithm on internet, but they are scattered, sometimes only sample code was given and I have to write test code, I would prefer a central place for both sample code and test case. <br> 
This project provides various algorithm implementation and corresponding test code in Java, when I do practice, I comment existing implementation logic and write my own implementation, then run unit test code to verify if my code works properly. Repeat this procedure until understand the algorithm.<br>
Most source code is originated from book "Beginning Algorithms" written by Simon Harris and James Ross, but the algorithm in this project is not limited to the algorithm in that book, I add more algorithm I practised into the project.<br>
